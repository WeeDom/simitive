Not much to see on this end, to be honest, but I hope my commit history and comments show my direction of travel

It's worth mentioning, possibly, that I did lose a fair bit of time getting the db connection working... normally I've been working with frameworks like Laravel/Symfony/etc that just take care of that for me!
